This is my dissertation project, researching into the design of synthesizer interfaces in order to improve readability and user experience, to aid beginner
users in learning how to program synthesizers without confusion by building a simplified, and self-explanatory interface.

This project was inspired by my love of music production, and some of the trials and tribulations that I ran into when first learning how to produce.

This project was my first open source project, please feel free to fork it and make any changes.
